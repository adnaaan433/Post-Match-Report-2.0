# Post-Match-Report-2.0
Hi there, I am Adnan, data analysis enthusiast. In this repository I have uploaded the code for making the udated version of Post Match report which includes a lot of new things.

Requirments:
1. the match report you want to get, you have to find that match in (http://whoscored.com) website and clicking the match center, you have to download the html file (just click CTRL+S, and it will download the html file of that page)
2. you need to go to the (http://fotmob.com) and find the matchId of that match in the url of that match

User's Guideline:
1. download the Post_Match_Report_2.ipynb file
2. open it on jupyter notebook
3. run the cells under 'Libraries and Packages'
4. then paste the match html file path you have downloaded from Whoscored website
5. also pate the Fotmob matchId below
6. then download the xT_Grid.csv and teams_name_and_id.csv files from this repository and put those file paths where instructed
7. then following the reamining instructions explained in the notebook and runnuing the remaining cells will give you the output Post Match Reports and other dashboards
